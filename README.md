# Bamazon

Description:
"Bamazon" is an application that allows the user to see the items available for sale in a table style, along with how many are available in the inventory and the price of each item. It then allows the user to make a purchase and gives them their total depending on how many they request and the data will then be updated with the current amounts of items left in the inventory. If the amount they want is not available, they will be given an alert telling them there's not enough in stock.
